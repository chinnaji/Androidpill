## What to expect in Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition Apk + Obb

- ➡ Improved controls. GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition now features a control setup described as being similar to GTA 5. This means you won’t be playing with the same dated control schemes the original games used. Gunplay and targeting has been improved, as well as having better drive-by controls in San Andreas. The weapon and radio selection wheels are being updated, while navigation is also improved on the mini-maps. Nintendo Switch players will also benefit from gyro aiming.
- ➡ Increased resolution/framerate. Players on Xbox Series X and PS5 get to play these games at 4K 60 FPS. There’s no word on the resolution or framerate for other platforms yet. All versions are getting higher-resolution textures, increased draw distances, improved lighting and better weather effects.
- ➡ Instant mission restart. No more long periods of waiting, you can instantly restart any failed mission in all three games.
